# TODO

**Release dates and road map are estimates, and features can be changed at any time.**

# Bugs
*** OS's with 2000 or XP can be misidentified by Nessus showing both host messing up some of the graphs. ***

Idea for more debug information

	- add a way to spawn mysql/psql shell to the database
	- add tables for the OS data
	- prompt for password?
	- generate report based on scan_id/report id

- rewrite text for risks by severity
- Abstract the api for prawn to support different renders

## Ideas
### Core
- bug report info collection option
- Complete comments for all existing code
- More text generation from graphs
- pdf bookmarks / Table of Contents
- rewrite the application class
- check the config file for \t
- add create template option

### Parsers
- *Normalize the Schema to accomidate multiple scanners*
- Move all pci related host properties to their own table
- Create a Nessus document generator, for testing the parser
- Add Schema checks to make sure the schema is compatible with the version of risu
- Add Importer for Nessus SQLite Database Format
	- Requires decryption of the sqlite database
- *Add Parser for OpenVas Output*
- Add Parser for SecurityCenter Output
- Add Parser for Nexpose XML [Simple, Detailed]
- Add Parser for Qualys XML
- *Add Parser for Nmap XML*
- Add Parser for SAINT XML

###Models
- add hosts with crit/high/med/low queries
- add ibm to the os named_scopes

###Graphs
- *Move all graphs under Risu::Graphs*
- most common os graph
- vulns by service bar chart
- most common services graph
- most common vuln category
- # hosts by severity
- stig bar graph for cat 1 / 2 / 3
- unsupported vs supported os graph
- Add a CVSS risk factor graph
	- Item.joins(:plugin).group(:cvss_base_score).order("plugins.cvss_base_score DESC").limit(10).size
- security risk graph
- detailed linux graph
- detailed windows graph
- uniform graph colors
- vuln count by host graph top 10 vulns
- generate a graph matirx like exec summary detailed
- malware infection graph

###NessusReports / Templates
- Easier way to select the Scan to generate reports from
- Unsupported OS report
	- http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle
	- XP SP3 = April 8, 2014
	- Vista SP2 = April 11, 2017
	- 7 = January 14, 2020
	- 8 = January 10, 2023
	- 10 = October 14, 2025

	-http://www.scribd.com/doc/3752867/6/Vulnerability-Severity-Code-Definitions
	- Category I
		- Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker immediate access into a machine, allow superuser access, or bypass a firewall.These can lead to the immediate compromise of the web server allowing the attacker to take complete control of the web server and associated operating system, which can then be used as a resource to control other systems in your network.Some examples would be the running of unsupported software, anonymous access to privileged accounts, and the presence of sample applications installed on the web server.
	- Category II
		- Vulnerabilities aide the ability of an attacker to gain access into a machine, compromise sensitive data, or bypass a firewall.These will lead to the eventual compromise of the web server allowing the attacker to manipulate the content or server settings on the web server and have access to other systems in your network.Some examples would be trust relationships with unauthorized separate enclaves, non compliance with appropriate host operating system security controls, and the non compliance with the IAVM program.
	- Category III
		- Vulnerabilities that impact the security posture of the system and if configured, will improve the overall security of asset.These could result in the degradation of service, compromise of information, and in some cases lead to unauthorized access to the system. Some examples would be untrained staff, development tools on a production environment, and the uncontrolled release of information to the web server.
- template for rhs plugins

	- Fix list NessusReport?
	- Compact the data in tech findings to be more printer friendly
	- finding summary coversheet looks odd
	- [TEMPLATE] unsupported OS template
	- [API] add list of unsupported os ip's accessors
	- [TEMPLATE] detailed findings should be combined to save paper on printing
	- Sort Technical Findings NessusReport by count/score

- Added TOC/Index to the technical findings report, issue 15
- More text blocks for various plugins services
- finish implementation of service descriptions
- outstanding / very good / good / improvement needed / unsatisfactory
- report type rtf
  Per host
    - scan time start/end
    - remote host info is/netbios/name/dns/ip/mac

	- Parser tests
		- Add test for new XML element
		- Add test for new host properties tag
	- Model Tests
		- NessusReport
		- Item
		- Host
